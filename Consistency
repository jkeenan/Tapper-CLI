User experience is improved when all commands of a tool behave
similar. To ensure this kind of consistency, this file lists guidelines
that all commands need to honor.

* --verbose or -v gives more verbose output
* --quiet guarantees silence for success
* calling without parameters gives the help text
** does not apply to all -list command (obviously)
** if a command can work with defaults it still requires --default or -d 
   to fulfill the "no empty parameter list" requirement
* help messages SHOULD distinguish between required arguments and
  optional arguments
